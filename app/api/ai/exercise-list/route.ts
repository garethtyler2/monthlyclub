Please provide a JSON-formatted response that includes the top 10 most useful rehabilitation exercises for the injury below:

- Injury: ${injury}
- Context: ${context}

üè∑Ô∏è **Naming Rules**:
- Use the **base, singular form** (e.g., "Push Up", "Glute Bridge")
- ‚ùå Do NOT include gerunds, plural forms, or modifiers: "Push Ups", "Bridging", "Bird Dog Hold", "Push Up Variation"
- ‚ùå Avoid all variations or modifiers like "Banded", "Weighted", "Wall", or "Isometric"
- ‚ùå Do NOT use suffixes like "Hold", "Stretch", or "Against Wall"
- ‚úÖ If multiple versions of the same exercise exist, use the most **standardized, canonical** name
- ‚úÖ Keep names consistent across requests to ensure deduplication

üì¶ **Formatting Requirements**:
- Return exercises in order of usefulness (most essential first)
- Include sets, reps, instructions, and a short clinical note on why each is important
- Return exactly 10 exercises, unless fewer are truly appropriate

Do not include warm-ups, cooldowns, or general advice.

Return only the list of exercises in structured JSON using the provided schema.`,
