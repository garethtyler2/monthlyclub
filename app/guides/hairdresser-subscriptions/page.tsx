              <h2>Why Subscriptions Work for Hairdressers</h2>
              <p>
                Hairdressing is built on repeat visits ‚Äî most clients return every few weeks. A subscription plan gives them peace of mind and gives you the financial security of steady, predictable income.
              </p>
              <p>
                With fewer cancellations and easier scheduling, subscriptions mean you can plan your calendar in advance and spend less time on admin.
              </p>

              <h2>Example Plans You Can Offer</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Classic Cut Plan:</strong> One haircut every 4 weeks for ¬£35/month</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> Haircut + beard trim + head massage, monthly</li>
                <li><strong>Family Plan:</strong> Two adult cuts and one child‚Äôs cut each month</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Benefits for You</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>üìÖ Fewer last-minute cancellations</li>
                <li>üí∏ Reliable income every month</li>
                <li>‚è≥ Less time spent chasing appointments</li>
                <li>ü§ù Stronger client relationships</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
              <p>
                Monthly Club gives you a public page to list your plans, take subscriptions, and get paid through Stripe. You can send your link via WhatsApp, Instagram, or email.
              </p>

              <h2>Real Example: Lee the Barber</h2>
              <p>
                Lee runs a small barbershop in Manchester. He launched a ‚ÄúMonthly Trim Plan‚Äù with Monthly Club at ¬£30/month. Within two weeks, 8 clients signed up. Now, his Fridays are fully booked in advance ‚Äî and paid upfront.
