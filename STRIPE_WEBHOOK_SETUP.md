# Stripe Webhook Setup for Business Status Updates

## Overview

This document explains how to set up Stripe webhooks to automatically update business status from 'pre-stripe' to 'active' when Stripe onboarding is completed.

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Businesses were getting stuck in 'pre-stripe' status even after completing Stripe onboarding, causing the "Finish Setup" button to keep showing in the navbar.

**Root Cause**: No webhook was listening for Stripe account updates to detect when onboarding was complete.

**Solution**: Added webhook handlers for `account.updated` events that automatically check if a business is fully onboarded and update their status.

## New Webhook Events

### 1. `payment_intent.succeeded`
- **Triggers**: When a payment intent succeeds (including one-time purchases)
- **Logic**: Checks if `purchase_type` metadata is 'one_time' to handle one-time purchases
- **Action**: Updates payment status, sends success notifications to customer and business

### 2. `account.updated`
- **Triggers**: When any Stripe account details are updated
- **Logic**: Checks if `details_submitted` and `charges_enabled` are both `true`
- **Action**: Updates business status to 'active' and sends activation email

## How It Works

1. **User completes Stripe onboarding** ‚úÖ
2. **Stripe sends `account.updated` webhook** üì°
3. **Webhook checks account status** üîç
4. **If fully onboarded, updates business status to 'active'** ‚úÖ
5. **Sends business activation email** üìß
6. **"Finish Setup" button disappears** üéâ

## Webhook Configuration

### Required Stripe Webhook Endpoint
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook
```

### Required Events
- `checkout.session.completed` (existing)
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` (existing)
- `payment_intent.succeeded` (NEW - for one-time payments)
- `account.updated` (NEW)

### Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded` ‚Üê **Add this one**
   - `account.updated` ‚Üê **Add this one**
4. Save the webhook

## Manual Fix for Existing Businesses

If you have businesses already stuck in 'pre-stripe' status, you can run the utility script:

```bash
npm run fix-stuck-businesses
```

This script will:
1. Find all businesses with 'pre-stripe' status
2. Check their Stripe account status
3. Update them to 'active' if they're fully onboarded
4. Show detailed logs of what was found and updated

## Testing the Webhook

1. **Create a test business** and go through Stripe setup
2. **Complete Stripe onboarding** in test mode
3. **Check webhook logs** in your application logs
4. **Verify business status** changes to 'active' automatically
5. **Confirm "Finish Setup" button** disappears from navbar

## Logs to Watch For

When the webhook works correctly, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Account updated: acct_123... Details submitted: true Charges enabled: true
‚úÖ Business status updated to 'active' for: Business Name
‚úÖ Business activated email sent to: owner@email.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Firing
- Check Stripe webhook endpoint configuration
- Verify webhook secret in environment variables
- Check application logs for webhook errors

### Status Not Updating
- Verify `account.updated` event is selected in Stripe
- Check if business has valid `stripe_account_id`
- Look for database update errors in logs

### Email Not Sending
- Check email API configuration
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable
- Check email service logs

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Code Location

The webhook handler is implemented in:
```
app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts
```

Look for the `account.updated` event handler around line 250-300.
